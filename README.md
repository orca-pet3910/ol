# ol
i made a language called 'ol' (no reason for the name, just random)

## how do i use this thing
make a file "main.ol" in the same dir as the launch dir of the script and then write some code (`help` for help)

## does this have loops? conditions? inline math operations???
nope

## how do i separate statements?
**(important, do NOT get confused)** a double whitespace. also it apparently breaks strings when double whitespaces are in a string because of my coding skills

enjoy this useless thing i made for totally no reason
